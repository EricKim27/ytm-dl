This program is for downloading your playlists on youtube to a directory in mp3. 

The downloaded file will have its album artwork(or the thumbnail of the video), with artist name, title, and album name(same as the title).

# How to use

First, set your destination directory and your playlist URL by making a file called settings.conf in the code directory and then type in:

```
TARGET <your target directory>
URL <your playlist URL>
```

and then run

```
python main.py
```

To sync your music to the specified directory.
